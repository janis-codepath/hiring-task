Hi Dennis!

Thank you for reaching out, and we appreciate your interest. We commend you for completing all the requirements for the Tech Fellow application!

At the moment, your application is still being processed. Before we can admit tech fellows into the tech fellow training, there has to be at least one more eligible Tech Fellow from the same school who completed the requirements as well. This means that until there are at least two applicants who completed the admissions requirements, we wonâ€™t be able to admit them, and they stay in the pipeline. This waiting process sometimes takes close to a month.

Please rest assured that there is no problem with your application and we will get back to you as soon as the process is completed.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
