Hi John!

Thank you for reaching out, and we appreciate your interest in taking our program. We understand your concern, however, we cannot transfer you to the Advanced rank. The first few topics from the tasks may be similar, however, the pacing of the tracks greatly depends on the level of the course.

We admit students based on their technical interview skills, and we don’t want to put you into a class that’s either too advanced or too basic for you so that you get the best experience possible.

I hope you understand where we're coming from, and we wish you all the best moving forward.
    
All the best,

CodePath.org Team
