Hi Anne,

Thank you for your interest in applying to our Summer course. We sincerely apologize that we cannot accommodate your application since the class is full and we already have a long waitlist.

We try to make our courses available to as many people as possible, and it really breaks our hearts to turn you down, so we hope we can help you with this [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view). You might find helpful tips and guidelines from this guide. We also have many [online resources for learning Android](https://support.codepath.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-can-i-get-started-learning-android-development-online) including an extensive list of [Android resources online](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Beginning-Android-Resources#beginning-android-resources). You can also sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) in case there are future courses or virtual events that you might be interested in.

We wish you the best of luck!

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
