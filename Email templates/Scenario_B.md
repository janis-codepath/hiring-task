Hi Jane,

We really appreciate your interest in taking our classes. We know the application process is very tedious, and we realize your effort in completing all the necessary steps on the application process. However, we apologize that we cannot accomodate your request.

Based on the current sponsorships we receive as a non-profit organization, our courses are restricted to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. CodePath currently runs classes in Haiti, and we also used to run classes in Taiwan. We might be expanding to other countries in the future but not as of yet.

We are sincerely sorry that you did not pass the eligibity requirements for our program. We always make sure that our applicants are well-informed about our eligibility requirements that is why all of our applications have at least two sections for eligibility checks on the front page.

We hope to be able to bring programs to your area soon and expand our audience for future programs. If you sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst), weâ€™ll notify you as classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means.

We really hope for your understanding, and we wish you the best of luck moving forward.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
