Hi Jake!

Thank you for reaching out! Here are the remaining steps for you to complete your application:

1.Submit your todo app for review via **Github**.
2. Add edit functionality to your todo app.
3. Extend your todo app, improve your UI, and add features.

Please click this [link](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/prework) if you need a more detailed explanation of the steps. They are steps 3, 4, and 5 on the list.

Regarding the class schedule, classes meet **once or twice per week for 1-2 hour sessions** over the duration of the semester. However, session frequency and duration may still vary depending on the college. Also, aside from the live session, students should also plan to spend 5-10 hours outside of class working on weekly assignments and their final group project.

I hope I was able to answer your inquiries and help you with your application.

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
